# Independence of functional data

#### authors: Łukasz Smaga, Jędrzej Wydra

## History
This project is truly a dream come true for me—it’s all about developing a new test for the independence of functional data. But, of course, with great dreams come great challenges. First, designing new statistical tests is no walk in the park; it’s more like navigating a maze in the dark. Second, functional data is notoriously tricky — working with it feels like trying to solve a puzzle where the pieces keep changing shape. Despite these hurdles, I’m thrilled to tackle this project, knowing that if it succeeds, it could make a significant impact in the field.

## Disclaimer
The simulations for this project are still ongoing, and it’s far from completion — there’s plenty of work left to do. In the meantime, you can find two of the early Python scripts available in this repository. Stay tuned for more updates as the project progresses!
